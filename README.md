After completing this assignment I understand how to override mathematical operators, how objects can return objects of other classes as responses to messages.
It also helped me to understand how to execute Python code which spans multiple files, how to create my own exception classes.
In this assignment I:
- initialized an object from a set of parameters;
- initialize a set of objects from a complex data structure;
- raised exceptions/errors as appropriate.
- parsed strings to isolate specific symbols.
